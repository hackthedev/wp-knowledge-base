# Tutorials & Handbooks
This plugin enables you to list and manage tutorials and handbooks on your WordPress site. From the admin dashboard, you can easily create new posts (referred to as \"tutorials\"). These tutorials can be locked, restricting access to specific users. It\'s possible to manually grant users access to individual posts, and you can also mark a post as \"not listed\" and assign it to a specific userâ€”ideal for custom-made tutorials or private documentation.

Currently, users must be manually assigned to tutorials, as this plugin was initially designed for companies with a small customer base requiring custom documentation. The purpose of this plugin is to provide such companies (or any users) with a platform to create, host, and share documentation with their customers, friends, or communities.

## PayPal Integration
This plugin comes with its own PayPal Integration. You can set posts as "paid" and set a price so only after purchase a post is available.

## Screenshots
The CSS in the screenshots is modified to fit my theme which is the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme. The custom CSS from the Screenshots can be found in the `additional-style.css` file
