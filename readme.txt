Create, manage, and restrict access to tutorials and handbooks, with features for manual user assignment and private content sharing.

== Description ==
This plugin enables you to list and manage tutorials and handbooks on your WordPress site. From the admin dashboard, you can easily create new posts (referred to as \"tutorials\"). These tutorials can be locked, restricting access to specific users. It\'s possible to manually grant users access to individual posts, and you can also mark a post as \"not listed\" and assign it to a specific userâ€”ideal for custom-made tutorials or private documentation.

Currently, users must be manually assigned to tutorials, as this plugin was initially designed for companies with a small customer base requiring custom documentation. The purpose of this plugin is to provide such companies (or any users) with a platform to create, host, and share documentation with their customers, friends, or communities.

Future updates will aim to automate this process, potentially adding an optional purchase button, either through direct PayPal integration or WooCommerce support.
